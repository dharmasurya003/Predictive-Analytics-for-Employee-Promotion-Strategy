# Predictive-Analytics-for-Employee-Promotion-Strategy


## Project Overview
This project aims to leverage Human Resources (HR) data to develop a predictive model that identifies potential candidates for promotion. Through comprehensive data analysis and application of machine learning algorithms, the project provides insights into the factors influencing employee promotions, assisting HR management in making informed decisions.

## Key Features

**Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature engineering to prepare the dataset for modeling.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualization and statistical analysis to understand the distribution and relationship of variables.

**Predictive Modeling:** Utilization of multiple machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost, to predict employee promotions.

**Model Evaluation:** Performance of models evaluated using accuracy, F1 score, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC score.

**Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimization of model parameters for Gradient Boosting and XGBoost to enhance model performance.

**Feature Importance Analysis:** Identification of the most significant features influencing the promotion decisions.

## Technologies Used
Python
Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation
Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization
Scikit-learn, XGBoost for machine learning models
Jupyter Notebook as the development environment


## Dataset
The dataset for this project includes HR data from a live hackathon on Analytics Vidhya. It consists of 54,808 observations with 14 features, including employee ID, department, region, education, gender, recruitment channel, number of trainings, age, previous year rating, length of service, KPIs met >80%, awards won, average training score, and promotion status.

## Conclusions
The project successfully identifies key factors that influence employee promotions and implements a machine learning model to predict potential candidates for promotion. The Gradient Boosting and XGBoost models, after hyperparameter tuning, showed the best performance based on the evaluation metrics.
