# Human-Resource-Analytics
# OBJECTIVE
To build a predictive model that can accurately identify the employees who are likely to be promoted based on their
past and current performance, along with demographic data.
To help the client expedite the promotion cycle for eligible candidates.
To identify the right people for promotion and prepare them in time.

# Problem statement
The client is a large multinational corporation with nine different verticals.
The client is facing issues in identifying the right employees for promotion up to the manager level and preparing
them in time.
The current process involves identifying a set of employees based on recommendations and past performance.
Selected employees go through vertical-specific training and evaluation programs.
Promotions are based on training performance, KPI completion (with a threshold of 80%), etc.
Final promotions are only announced after the evaluation process, which leads to delays in the transition to the new
roles.
